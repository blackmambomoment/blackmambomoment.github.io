This will ensure that employees always have the most accurate and up-to-date information.\nBe Accessible: Employees should be able to easily access their benefit statements whenever they need them. Make sure they’re available online, in print, or both.\nFeedback Loop: Last but not least, get feedback from your employees on their benefit statements.
