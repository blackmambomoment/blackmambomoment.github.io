These programs typically run for four to six weeks, providing students with the opportunity to delve deeply into a particular subject area or skill set. Full-time programs often include a combination of classroom instruction, hands-on activities, and field trips.</p><h3 id=part-time-programs><strong>Part-Time Programs</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#part-time-programs>#</a></h3><p>If you have other commitments during the summer but still want to enrich your learning, part-time summer programs offer a flexible alternative.
