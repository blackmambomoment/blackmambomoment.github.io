But I&rsquo;m about to walk you through the application process and everything else you need to know.</p><p><strong>Eligibility Criteria</strong></p><p>Before you apply for NSFAS accommodation funding, it&rsquo;s important to make sure you&rsquo;re eligible.

During this period, NSFAS will verify your details through the Department of Home Affairs, universities, and the South African Revenue Service (SARS).</p><p><strong>Factors Determining the Amount of Funding</strong></p><p>The amount of accommodation funding you can receive depends on several factors, including:</p><ul><li>Your household income.</li><li>Your accommodation type (private, shared, or student housing).</li><li>The location of your accommodation (urban or rural).</li><li>Your institution.</li></ul><p><strong>Payment Process and Disbursement</strong></p><p>If your application is successful, NSFAS will pay the accommodation funds directly to the institution.
